Three Rings for the Elven Lords under the Sky
Seven for the Dwarf Lords in their halls of Stone
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them
One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them

In the Land of Mordor where the shadows lieâ€¦.
The ring of power and of doom
The ring of evil and of shadows
Was made to adorn the finger of the Sauron
And keep where the darkness looms
Of power and of greatness lie
Keeps those who bear it doomed to die
